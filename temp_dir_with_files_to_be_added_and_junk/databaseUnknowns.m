% find those which have less than 4 erros. check their Hamming distnace to the rest to see if multiplying them is problematic or not



compare  -

real matrix - move to 4 letter
N is due to polymorphism or.

how many are there

i
The differnece between real experiment and this one
take only those that have low enough (up to 4 errors)
throw away those that have too many errors.
talk to Amit about to ho weigh them

another possiblity:
go over the data and replace to one letter randomly

calculate the Hamming distance of all remaining bac
to those with errors - are they
